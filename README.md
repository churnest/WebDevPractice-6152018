Instructions
------------

Your goal is to make your web page look like the included mockup (`basic-web-site-mockup.png`).

Included is an HTML "boilerplate" found in the index-boilerplate.htm file. You will need to create an HTML file called
`index.htm` (this is a special name - more on that later) using this boilerplate, with your additional content. We 
would encourage you to *not* copy and paste the code, but rather write it out for your learning.

In the boilerplate is a reference to a CSS file (in the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">` tag). We have 
created the directory called `css`, but you will need to create the CSS file, and its contents to style your page.

Let us know in Slack if you have any questions. Have fun! Muah ha ha ha
